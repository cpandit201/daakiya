### Acknowledgement
This project heavily uses Location APIs endpoints provided by HERE Technologies with hosting and database in Google Firebase. 
It heavily compliments the use of various Developer APIs including Routing, Geocoding, Places, Transit, Waypoints, Interactive Maps Javascript, HERE Tracking, HERE XYZ Studio, HERE XYZ Hub and HERE We Go (Web and Mobile). 
You can get an access to HERE
freemium developer offering from HERE at https://developer.here.com/ to try it out.

Along with getting an access to HERE Location APIs, you will also have to have a project in Firebase, Go to https://console.firebase.google.com for getting an access.

I am really thankful to HERE Technologies and Google Firebase and Browserstack to provide me with their infra for accomplishing this project.
